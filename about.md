<img class="profile-picture" src="/assets/duck-with-knife.png">

I'm Hariom Narang, a software engineer from Bangalore, India. I currently work at [qure.ai](https://www.qure.ai), leading the XRay processing team. Stuff that I've particularly enjoyed working with here includes working on a lot of developer productivity challenges arising from a huge monorepo housing computer vision models and optimising inference performance.  


I've always loved reading books (I'm one of the fallen [Malazan](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen) readers who just can't finish the series). Currently reading Stormlight archives. Recently have started liking sketching a lot, I hope to create realistic potraits some day :)

PS: Why the duck? I kinda just find them cool, I don't have a pet or anything, but ducks as memojis are the best.
